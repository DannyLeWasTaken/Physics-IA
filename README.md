# Physics IA github repo

As part of my physics IA, I decided to create a small project dedicated to simulating a lab enviroment of a block falling down a ramp.

## What does each file do
This is a brief overview of what each file does:
main.py - The code that is responsible for creating the simulation
license.txt - The license of this open source project (MIT)
NOTICE.md - Requird notice files added in such as bullet physics notice files
